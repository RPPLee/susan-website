## What are Peer Circles?

Peer Circles are discussion groups, planned and facilitated by Susan, that meet regularly to advise, support, and possibly act with each other on a shared interest or purpose. Every Peer Circle is unique -- groups form for a purpose and time-period defined by an organizer.

Each Peer Circle meeting is documented in a confidential report of notes and agreements provided to attendees.

## Types of Circles

Peer Circles can be formed by many types of groups:

- **CEOs & Founders** -- peer support for business leaders
- **Cross-functional teams** -- Marketing + Engineering, Board + Operations
- **Investors and Board** -- alignment on vision and governance
- **Community Collaborations** -- policies, programs, shared initiatives
- **Value chain partnerships** -- logistics and supply chain alignment
- **Issue-focused groups** -- addressing specific challenges or themes

## How It Works

**Formation**: Groups are organized around a shared purpose, with clear policies and participant invitations.

**Frequency**: Circles can meet weekly, monthly, or on a schedule that fits the group. Commitments typically span six months to a year.

**Size**: Membership is limited to 10 or fewer participants per circle. Larger groups can be split into 4-6 person breakout circles.

**Financial models** can include fee per meeting, sponsored, donation, or pay-as-you-like arrangements.

## Special Purpose Circles

Special purpose Peer Circles can be developed for collective experiences such as:

- Saving and lending circles
- Gifting initiatives
- Time-based community exchanges
- Collective investment groups
