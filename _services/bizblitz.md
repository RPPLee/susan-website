## What is BizBlitz?

BizBlitz is Susan's signature offering. In one intense hour, she walks a founder through defining four key elements of their business:

1. **Market Position** -- Where you stand in the competitive landscape
2. **Value Proposition** -- What makes you uniquely valuable to your customers
3. **Competitive Landscape** -- Who else is playing in your space and how you differ
4. **Action Plan** -- Concrete next steps to move forward with clarity

Founders walk out with clarity they didn't have walking in.

## Who Is It For?

BizBlitz is ideal for:

- **Startup founders** who need to sharpen their pitch and strategy
- **Entrepreneurs at a crossroads** trying to decide on direction
- **Small business owners** looking to refine their market position
- **Teams** that need alignment on business fundamentals

## How It Works

BizBlitz sessions can be offered as one-on-one sessions or in small group formats. Susan brings decades of experience across hundreds of companies to rapidly identify your strengths, gaps, and opportunities.

Each session is tailored to where you are right now -- whether you're pre-launch, scaling, or pivoting.

## What You'll Walk Away With

- A clear articulation of your unique market position
- Understanding of your competitive advantages
- A prioritized action plan for the next 30-90 days
- Fresh perspective from someone who's guided 200+ companies
