## What is Performance?

Aligning intentions to actions to ensure ongoing accountability, adaptability, and functional help. This work supports and supplements the capabilities of leaders and team members when outside perspectives -- and another pair of hands -- can help.

As with all our services, Performance work is always customized to client circumstances.

## Three Areas of Focus

### Assessment

Assessment develops tools and processes to evaluate, reward, adjust, adapt, or shift the work of people and processes in light of their pre-established objectives. This includes:

- Performance evaluation frameworks
- Progress tracking systems
- Adaptation and course-correction recommendations
- Reward and recognition structures

### Partnerships, Alliances, Collaborations

This is Community Building and Relationship Building work -- probably one of our favorite roles. This service blends listening, planning, and delivering value with others in ways where all parties gain.

We are particularly strong in this area and see this as the core of sustained healthy growth. Services include:

- Partner identification and outreach
- Alliance structuring and negotiation
- Collaborative program design
- Stakeholder relationship management

### Project & Task Management

Hands-on execution of planned work. We tap our extensive network of collaborators to find temporary or part-time teammates able to work in the area needing help and within the group's culture to bring additional strength to operations.

This includes:

- Project planning and execution oversight
- Task prioritization and delegation
- Progress monitoring and reporting
- Team coordination and communication

## Pricing

Work can be performed as a retainer or as a per-task set-fee or hourly fee, usually for a focused time period. Contact Susan to discuss your specific needs and circumstances.
