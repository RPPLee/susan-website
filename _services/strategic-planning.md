## What is Strategic Planning?

Planning and plans is the focus of this service. This entails developing in-depth strategic or tactical business and action plans usually with timelines. Often these assignments require multiple types of services and special tasks. We accept only one Strategic Planning client per calendar quarter to ensure full dedication to your success.

## Three Areas of Focus

### Position & Purpose

Position & Purpose is strategic planning at its core. It encompasses services that may include:

- Creative brainstorming or strategic planning workshops
- Market or other types of research
- Value chain analysis
- Branding and related communications

The result is to define your unique role and value in the context of the world in which you operate -- across all key aspects of Operations (Partnerships, Product, Market, Distribution, Manufacturing, Customer Support). This work can be framed as an investor funding plan and solicitation approach.

### Scenario Planning

Scenario Planning weighs strategic alternatives through a leadership workshop format. With skill and insight, facilitated conversations, exercises, and homework efficiently distill various perspectives held within the group to identify:

- Core alignment across the team
- Divergences in perspective and priority
- Creative thinking and new possibilities
- Viable directions that tap the capabilities and interests of the team

Decisions on which scenario to pursue may require further research.

### Organization & Operations

Organization & Operations plans the organizational design as well as the tactical mapping of tasks, time, and money for functional operations. It details:

- Development, delivery, and ongoing quality of products and services
- Well-understood roles and responsibilities paired with financial objectives
- Values and policies applied to culture and performance
- Governance, brand development, product/services development
- Customer and community relations

## Planning Retreat Format

Strategic Planning can be delivered as an intensive retreat:

1. **Overview** of vision, goals, and timeline
2. **Current situation mapping** -- stakeholders, partners, resources
3. **Universe mapping** -- multi-dimensional look at partnership opportunities
4. **Vision blending** -- combining vision + reality + impact connections
5. **Roadmap development** -- typically a 3-year plan from now to your future

## Pricing

Each engagement is a retained relationship. Cost is based upon the scope and timing of the deliverables required. Contact Susan to discuss your needs.
