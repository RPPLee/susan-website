## What is Coaching & Mentoring?

Coaching is talking, listening, and advising shared between you and Susan in regularly scheduled counseling sessions. Any topic can be raised. This work may take place in person or via phone or video calls as is most convenient. It can include companionship in meetings, travel, or other gatherings.

No defined outcome or "deliverable product" such as a report or task accomplishment is part of this work. For many individuals experiencing life transitions, coaching may be the only service they need -- simply connecting with a supporting, experienced, reflective confidant.

## Who Is It For?

- **Entrepreneurs** navigating the challenges of building a business
- **Executives** working through leadership transitions
- **Individuals** experiencing life changes who want experienced counsel
- **Community leaders** seeking guidance on initiatives and partnerships
