## What is Team Building?

Teaming services focus on group performance based upon shared vision, clear roles and responsibilities, decision-making parameters, and resolution of differences. This can involve individual (perhaps confidential) input as well as facilitated group discussion sessions.

This work is unique to each circumstance and typically entails a commitment by the client to work for a set time period in order to establish and learn teaming practices.

## Who Is It For?

Team Building typically incorporates cross-functional roles within the same organization who wish to align, communicate, and act more effectively:

- **Boards and Operating Executives** -- bridging governance and operations
- **Functional Departments** -- breaking down silos between teams
- **Distinct Interest Groups** -- aligning stakeholders with different perspectives
- **Merged Teams** -- building culture after organizational changes

## How It Works

### Phase 1: Planning
An initial planning phase defines the project, reflecting a commitment of up to five hours. Development of an agenda and goals are likely outcomes of this time.

### Phase 2: Team Development
The teambuilding work itself is typically a retained assignment for three to six months, priced to reflect the objectives and scope of the project. Sessions blend:

- Individual confidential input
- Facilitated group discussions
- Shared exercises and workshops
- Agreed-upon practices and accountability measures
